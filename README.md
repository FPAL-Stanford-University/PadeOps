# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### PadeOps ###

* Quick summary : Hybrid OpenMP/MPI derivate operators using Compact Difference (6th and 10th Order) and Spectral (Fourier and Chebyshev) Methods to solve PDEs.
* Version : 0.1
* Tutorials : TBD/Incomplete

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
* Configuration :
    * Set the Fortran compiler (FC) and the FFTW library path (FFTW_PATH) in SetupEnv.sh
    * Then run:
    * source SetupEnv.sh
    * mkdir build
    * cd build
    * cmake ..
    * make
* Dependencies : MPI, FFTW
* Database configuration : TBD
* How to run tests : TBD
* Deployment instructions : TBD

### Contribution guidelines ###
