Ryan: 
[x] 1. Finish mpi-calls inside sortAndExhange (PRIORITY 1) 
[x] 2. Periodic offsets as needed.  (PRIORITY 2) 
[x] 3. Fix the spectral gap - play with kmin and nk (PRIORITY 3) 
[x] 4. Run HIT - small scale with uniform velocity for large scale - ensure that mode advance works. (PRIORITY 4) 
[_] 5. Update neighbor ranks to mpi_proc_null if periodicity is not present (LOWEST PRIORITY)
[x] 6. set up domain min max user function
[x] 7. Learn how to use interpolator and interp from S1 to S2 grid
[_] 8. Large scale manipulation happens before enrich%init()

Aditya: 
[x] 1. LG inputs
[_] 2. Create small scale KE and Liso inputs
