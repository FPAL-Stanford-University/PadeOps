[x] 1. Finish mpi-calls inside sortAndExhange (PRIORITY 1) 
[x] 2. Periodic offsets as needed.  (PRIORITY 2) 
[x] 3. Fix the spectral gap - play with kmin and nk (PRIORITY 3) 
[_] 4. Run HIT - small scale with uniform velocity for large scale - ensure that mode advance works. (PRIORITY 4) 
[_] 5. Update neighbor ranks to mpi_proc_null if periodicity is not present (LOWEST PRIORITY)
