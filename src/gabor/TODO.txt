1. Finish mpi-calls insude sortAndExhange (PRIORITY 1) 
2. Periodic offsets as needed.  (PRIORITY 2) 
3. Update neighbor ranks to mpi_proc_null if periodicity is not present (LOWEST PRIORITY)
4. Fix the spectral gap - play with kmin and nk (PRIORITY 3) 
5. Run HIT - small scale with uniform velocity for large scale - ensure that mode advance works. (PRIORITY 4)
